## Neural network to make a dog smarter

we wanna enrich our silly dog to behave like this:

1. if you pet him, he sits down
2. if you whistle, he barks
3. if you whistle and pet him, he rolls


## Structure

two inputs: PET, WHISTLE

three outputs: SIT, BARK, ROLL


## Demo

[Smart Dog Demo](https://smikulic.github.io/smart_dog/)

You can adjust inputs and see the given percentage to what the output should look like, but also change the training iteration to see how it increases/decreseases in accuracy.


## Reference

made with a little bit of help from [Synaptic Library](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic) and [this article](http://progur.com/2016/09/how-to-create-and-use-neural-networks-in-javascript.html)
